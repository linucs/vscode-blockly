# Change Log

All notable changes to the "Blocks Editor" extension will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/).

## [0.0.1] - 2026-06-02

First public preview.

### Added

- **Visual block editor for source files** — open any `.cpp`, `.ino`, `.c` (and `.cc`, `.cxx`, `.pde`) file with the Blocks Editor and build your program by dragging blocks instead of typing code.
- **Live C++ code generation** — blocks generate real Arduino/C++ code as you build; `setup()` and `loop()` update automatically.
- **Multi-backend toolchain support** — automatic detection of PlatformIO (`platformio.ini`) and Arduino CLI (`sketch.yaml`) projects, with a chooser when both are present.
- **Board-aware toolbox** — reads the active board and framework from your project config and shows only the blocks that apply.
- **Automatic dependency management** — libraries required by the blocks in use are merged into your project config (add-only): `lib_deps` for PlatformIO, `libraries` for the Arduino CLI.
- **Persistent block state** — your layout is saved in a companion `.blk` file next to the source.
- **Extensible block catalogs** — define blocks in YAML and load them from local directories or remote URLs.
- **Built-in Arduino blocks** — Digital I/O, Analog I/O, Serial, SPI, Wire (I2C), Math, Strings, Time, Interrupts, and more, plus the standard Blockly categories (Logic, Loops, Math, Text, Variables, Arrays, Functions).
- **Workspace conveniences** — optional minimap, toolbox search, and customizable category colors.
- **Block Author chat participant** (`@blocks`) — assists in creating new block catalogs for hardware libraries.
